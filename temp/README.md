# KNUcalendar

KNUcalendar is a lightweight calendar that display events from a CSV file `202408.csv` on a webpage. 

## oneko.js

I modified the `oneko.js` library, originally from the [spicetify-oneko](https://github.com/kyrie25/spicetify-oneko) project. (Note that this project also contains modifications to oneko.js) Below are the key changes:

1. The kitten now interacts with **FullCalendar** elements, specifically the `#calendar` div.
2. The kitten falls asleep faster and sleeps more deeply.
